| **Safety Net** | **-50%** | Hard exit on premium loss |

**Current Setting**: `profit_target_amount = 350.0` (Hardcoded for safety)

### Priority 3: Trend Reversal (Safety Exit)
**Applies regardless of current profit. MUST BE CONFIRMED ON CANDLE CLOSE.**

#### For CALL (CE) Positions:
Exit if **PREVIOUS 15-min Candle** closed with:
- MACD crossing **BELOW** Signal (Bearish Crossover)
- +DI crossing **BELOW** -DI (Bearish DI Crossover)

#### For PUT (PE) Positions:
Exit if **PREVIOUS 15-min Candle** closed with:
- MACD crossing **ABOVE** Signal (Bullish Crossover)
- +DI crossing **ABOVE** -DI (Bullish DI Crossover)

*Note: This prevents exiting on intraday "ticks" that might reverse before the candle closes.*

##  PROFIT & LOSS CALCULATION

### How Profit is Calculated

**Formula**:
```
P&L (Rs) = (Exit Premium - Entry Premium)  Lot Size
P&L (%) = ((Exit Premium - Entry Premium) / Entry Premium)  100
```

**Example - NIFTY CALL**:
- Entry Premium: Rs 100
- Exit Premium: Rs 105
- Lot Size: 65
- **P&L**: (105 - 100)  65 = **Rs 325**
- **P&L %**: ((105 - 100) / 100)  100 = **5.0%**

### How Loss is Calculated

**Stop Loss Trigger** (based on spot movement):

**Example - NIFTY CALL with 0.70% SL**:
- Entry Spot: 25,000
- Current Spot: 24,825 (dropped 175 points = 0.70%)
- **Stop Loss TRIGGERED**  Exit at current premium

**Example - BANKNIFTY PUT with 1.20% SL**:
- Entry Spot: 50,000
- Current Spot: 50,600 (rose 600 points = 1.20%)
- **Stop Loss TRIGGERED**  Exit at current premium

 ##  DAILY WIN-LOCK (TRAILING SL)
 
 This system protects your accumulated daily profits by setting a rising "floor."
 
 | Total Daily Profit | Locked-In Floor | Logic |
 | :--- | :--- | :--- |
 | ₹350 - ₹699 | **₹250** | Locks in ₹250. |
 | ₹700 - ₹1,049 | **₹500** | Locks in ₹500. |
 | ₹1,050 - ₹1,399 | **₹750** | Locks in ₹750. |
 | ₹1400 - ₹1749 | **₹1000** | Locks in ₹1000 if profit reached ₹1400 |
 
 **How it works**:
 1. The bot tracks your **Peak Daily Profit** (including open trades).
 2. For every **₹350** of profit reached, it secures a floor **₹100** below that step.
 3. If your total P&L drops to this floor, the bot **immediately exits the current trade**.
 4. It does **NOT** stop for the day; it will look for new entries as per regular rules.

 ##  RE-ENTRY LOGIC

### First Trade of Day
- **Relaxed Entry**: Enters if trend is active (MACD > Signal for CE, MACD < Signal for PE)
- No fresh crossover required

### Subsequent Trades (Same Day)
- **Relaxed Entry**: Enters if trend is active (MACD > Signal for CE, MACD < Signal for PE)
- **NO Fresh Crossover Needed** (per latest update)
- **Anti-Duplication**: Still prevents re-entering the EXACT same strike.

---

##  SUMMARY OF KEY RULES

### Entry Decision
 All 7 common conditions must be TRUE  
 MACD signal appropriate for trade type (CE/PE)  
 First trade = Relaxed, Subsequent = Relaxed (Trend Active)
 
 ### Exit Decision (Priority Order)
 1. **Stop Loss**  Based on spot movement (VIX-adjusted)
 2. **Profit Target**  Based on hardcoded amount (Rs 350.0)
 3. **Trend Reversal**  MACD or DI crossover against position

### Profit/Loss Basis
- **Profit Target**: Calculated as **FIXED AMOUNT (Rs 350.0)**
- **Stop Loss**: Triggered by **UNDERLYING SPOT MOVEMENT** (0.7%-1.5% depending on index and VIX)
- **Final P&L**: Difference in premium  lot size

##  BOT MEMORY & PERSISTENCE

The bot uses a **Dual-Layer Memory System** to ensure safety across restarts:

1.  **Active Position Memory** (`data/positions.json`)
    *   **Function**: Remembers any trade currently open.
    *   **Behavior**: If you restart the bot while a trade is running, it will **resume management** (SL/Target) immediately. It will NOT forget the trade.

2.  **Daily History Memory** (`data/daily_history.json`)
    *   **Function**: Remembers all trades closed today.
    *   **Critical Safety**:
        *   **No Double Entry**: Prevents re-entering a symbol if a trade was already taken on the same signal.
        *   **Loss Tracking**: Calculates Total Daily P&L from *all* sessions today to enforce the **Daily Loss Limit**.

*This means you can safely stop/start the bot without losing track of your day's progress.*
